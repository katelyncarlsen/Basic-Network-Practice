# Basic-Network-Practice
Basic MLP architecture practice using the PyTorch library and the Iris dataset


- Designed to identify lily (flower) based off of four features: sepal_length,	sepal_width,	petal_length, petal_width	(see iris.csv)
- Used PyTorch, pandas, numpy, scikitlearn, and matplotlib
- Basic classification task, can be scaled to much larger sets of data
